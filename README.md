## City Power Consumption Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting city-level power consumption using Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to identify consumption patterns, explore relationships with external factors, and build a predictive model that helps in efficient energy planning and demand forecasting.

## Project Overview

City power consumption changes due to several factors including:

Weather conditions

Seasonal variations

Industrial activitie

Population behavior

## This project includes:

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔ Data preprocessing

✔ Feature engineering

✔ Machine Learning model building

✔ Result visualization

✔ Presentation summarizing insights

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning

Loaded Excel dataset

Handled missing values

Converted date/time columns

Removed inconsistent rows

Prepared features for modeling

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Power consumption trends

Seasonal variations

Correlation analysis

Temperature impact on consumption

Outlier detection

Visual plots to understand patterns

### 3. Feature Engineering

Lag features

Rolling averages

Date-time decomposition (year, month, day)

Normalization / scaling

### 4. Model Building

The project explores ML algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

ARIMA/SARIMA (if time-series model applied)

### 5. Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score

Charts comparing actual vs predicted values

## 📊 Visualizations Include

Consumption trend lines

Seasonal patterns

Monthly/annual comparison

Heatmaps

Forecast curves

Temperature vs consumption plots

These visualizations help reveal hidden insights in consumption behavior.
